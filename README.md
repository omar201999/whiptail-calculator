# Standard and Programmer Calculator with Bash Script and Whiptail

This repository contains a Bash script that implements a standard and programmer calculator using the Whiptail tool. The script allows you to perform basic arithmetic operations and programmer calculations. It provides a user-friendly interface for input and error handling.

## Features

- **Standard Calculator:** Perform addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division with real numbers. The calculator handles invalid inputs and division by zero.

- **Programmer Calculator:** Convert numbers between binary, decimal, and hexadecimal representations. It also handles invalid inputs and provides error messages when needed.

## Prerequisites

- **Bash Shell:** The script is written in Bash, so you need a Bash-compatible shell to run it.

- **`bc` Utility:** The script uses the `bc` utility for performing calculations. Ensure that `bc` is installed on your system.

- **Whiptail:** The user interface is created using the `whiptail` tool, which should be available on most Unix-like systems.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:
   
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/omar201999/whiptail-calculator.git
2. Change directory to the cloned repository:
   
   ```bash
   cd whiptail-calculator
3. Set execute permission on your script using chmod command: 
   
   ```bash
   chmod +x calculator.sh
4. Run the script:
   ```bash
   bash calculator.sh
5. Use the Whiptail interface to perform calculations and conversions.
## Standard Calculator
